## Why biochar matters

Biochar produced from hemp residues locks carbon in a stable form while improving soil structure. In desert soils, it enhances moisture retention and nutrient availability.

### Key benefits

- Long-term carbon sequestration
- Better water-holding capacity in arid soils
- Reduced fertilizer losses
