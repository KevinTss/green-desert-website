## Green Desert featured in Arab News

Green Desert is a **Saudi-based biotech startup** founded in 2020 by Abdulhadi Al-Amer and Lucas Dietrich. The company leverages industrial hemp to **support sustainability efforts in Saudi Arabia** and the wider region.

Green Desert develops **hemp-based solutions** across multiple sectors, including animal bedding (hurds/shives), hempcrete construction blocks, insulation and textile fibers, and hemp seeds for oil and animal feed. Hemp is positioned as a strategic crop due to its rapid growth, low water requirements, soil regeneration properties, and ability to capture carbon.

Beyond product development, Green Desert actively works to address regional misconceptions around hemp through education and international partnerships, highlighting that industrial hemp is non-psychoactive and suitable for sustainable industrial use.

The company has secured an official license from Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture and has established strategic collaborations, notably with France’s La Chanvrière. Through these initiatives, Green Desert aims to contribute to Saudi Vision 2030 by enabling scalable, plant-based industrial solutions.
