## Green Desert participates in Lithuanian hemp conference supporting “Kanapės 2035”

Green Desert participated in a major **industrial hemp conference** held in Lithuania, which brought together policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and international companies active across the hemp value chain.

The event focused on the proposal of a national development strategy titled **_Kanapės 2035_**, aiming to significantly scale Lithuania’s industrial hemp sector, including a potential **100-fold increase in fiber hemp cultivation**. Discussions covered regulatory frameworks, processing infrastructure, innovation, and the role of hemp in the European bioeconomy.

Green Desert was represented by its co-founder **Abdulhadi Al-Amer**, who took part as an international industry stakeholder. During the conference, Green Desert shared its perspective as a **MENA-based biotech company** developing hemp-based solutions for construction, agriculture, and industrial applications.

The participation highlighted Green Desert’s interest in **cross-regional collaboration** between Europe and the Middle East, particularly around sustainable materials, knowledge transfer, and scalable hemp value chains. These discussions align with the company’s broader mission to support climate-positive industrial solutions and contribute to long-term sustainability strategies such as **Saudi Vision 2030**.

By engaging in international forums like this conference, Green Desert continues to position itself as an **active contributor to the global industrial hemp ecosystem**, supporting policy dialogue, innovation, and responsible market development.
