## Partnership Overview

Green Desert has entered a strategic partnership with La Chanvriere to accelerate sustainable agricultural practices across the Middle East. The collaboration leverages La Chanvriere's processing expertise and Green Desert's licensed hemp programs to deliver traceable, circular biomass supply chains.

### What this enables

- Joint R&D on climate-adapted hemp cultivars
- Shared processing standards and QA/QC protocols
- Pilot programs for regenerative farming and biomaterials
