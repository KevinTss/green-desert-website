## Why hempcrete matters

Hempcrete delivers breathable, low-carbon envelopes that reduce cooling loads while storing biogenic carbon. For desert climates, its vapor-permeable profile and thermal inertia support healthier indoor environments.

### Key benefits

- Lower embodied carbon compared to cementitious systems
- Superior moisture regulation to reduce mold risk
- Acoustic comfort for dense urban developments
