      "Green Desert is a Saudi Arabian biotechnology company founded in 2020, dedicated to developing sustainable, science-driven solutions for some of the region’s most pressing environmental and industrial challenges. Operating at the intersection of biotechnology, materials science, and circular economy principles, the company works across multiple sectors including construction, sustainable materials, plant-based products, and bio-industrial applications.",
      "With deep expertise in industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), Green Desert was the first company to obtain an official license in Saudi Arabia to research, import, and develop hemp-based solutions. This specialization enables the company to deliver regenerative materials, localized supply chains, and scalable innovations aligned with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and the ambitions of major regional development projects.",
      "By combining scientific research, regulatory alignment, and industrial execution, Green Desert advances plant-based technologies—both hemp-derived and beyond—to support a more resilient, low-impact, and future-ready economy across Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and Africa."
