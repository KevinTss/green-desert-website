Comprehensive Code Analysis (Consolidated)

Executive Summary

The Next.js multilingual site has solid foundations. Recent fixes addressed markdown XSS and added robots, sitemap, and JSON‑LD; image optimization for static export was also added. Remaining work focuses on performance visibility, error boundaries, accessibility, and component cleanup.

High Priority

1) Bundle Visibility and Size
- Observation: node_modules ~495MB locally. No bundle analyzer configured.
- Action: Add @next/bundle-analyzer for insight; consider dependency pruning and route-level code splitting review.

2) Error Boundaries Missing
- Files: No app/error.tsx or app/global-error.tsx present.
- Action: Add error boundaries to improve resilience and UX.

Medium Priority

3) Accessibility Gaps
- Likely missing ARIA on some interactive elements; verify keyboard focus order; refine RTL typographic classes throughout (e.g., mirrored paddings/margins and direction-aware icons).

4) Code Organization and DX
- Magic strings (translation keys) live inline; consider central validation and key typing.
- Add lightweight logging and error handling helpers.
- Consider a small types/ folder if shared types grow.

Low Priority

5) Internationalization Enhancements
- Add pluralization, number/date formatting, and potential lazy-loading of translations. Ensure consistent RTL handling.

6) Development Experience
- CI/CD: Present (GitHub Actions deploy to Pages). Keep.
- Tests: None detected. Add minimal unit tests for utility functions and rendering tests for critical components.
- Performance monitoring can be added later (e.g., web vitals reporting).

Corrections to Previous Reports

- Build Config Checks: Current next.config.mjs has eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: false and typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: false (i.e., checks are enabled). The earlier claim that they are disabled is outdated.
- Markdown Parser: The project uses remark (a standard library), not a custom parser. The issue is the lack of sanitization before dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
- Type Safety: lib/blog.ts defines a BlogPost interface and uses typed functions; the cited "any" usage and unsafe cast locations do not exist as previously reported.
- CI/CD: A deploy workflow exists at .github/workflows/deploy.yml; earlier note about missing CI/CD was inaccurate.

Duplicate “Section 6 – News” Components

- Files: components/section-6-news.tsx, components/section-6-news-server.tsx, components/section-6-news-client.tsx
- Current usage: app/[lang]/page.tsx imports Section6NewsClient only.
- Differences:
  • section-6-news-client.tsx: uses lib/blog-static.ts (static data) for client rendering.
  • section-6-news-server.tsx: loads posts via lib/blog.ts server-side.
  • section-6-news.tsx: expects latestPosts props; appears unused.
- Recommendation: Consolidate to one implementation to avoid drift.
  • If dynamic markdown posts are required on the home page, use the server version and remove the others.
  • If static demo content suffices, keep the client version and delete the unused server/prop-driven variant.

Revised Implementation Order

1) Component hygiene: Consolidate Section 6 News
2) Accessibility pass: ARIA, keyboard navigation, RTL polish
3) DX and performance: add tests, enable @next/bundle-analyzer
4) Internationalization enhancements

Notes and Pointers

- Blog rendering: Content is sanitized via rehype-sanitize before rendering.
- Images: Prebuild WebP implemented; consider adding AVIF and optimizing large videos (e.g., sliderV.mp4) as a follow‑up.
- Params typing: Several routes type params as Promise<...> and then await it. Next.js typically passes plain objects; consider using the conventional non-Promise param typings for clarity.
